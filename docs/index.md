# Maze Prank Game

## The Big Idea

Welcome to Maze Prank Game, a game where your cursor is the player! Enter an adorable field of green grass and flowers. Use your cursor to navigate through the maze and don't touch outside the path, otherwise you'll have to restart.

But there's a surprise waiting somewhere in the field, so don't concentrate too hard! The end is all for 
fun's sake, our team means no harm!

Here's what the game looks like when starting it up:
